# Since .env is gitignored, you can use .env.example to build a new `.env` file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \`.env\`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env` and populate it with your secrets.

# Database removed - not needed for citation formatting


# You can generate the secret via 'openssl rand -base64 32' on Unix
# @see https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation

# GROBID server URL for citation parsing
# Default: https://kermitt2-grobid.hf.space (HuggingFace demo server with DL models)
# Alternative: https://kermitt2-grobid-crf.hf.space (faster CRF-only, lower accuracy)
# For production: deploy your own GROBID server
